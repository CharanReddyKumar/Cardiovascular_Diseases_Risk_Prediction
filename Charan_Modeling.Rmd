## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(skimr)
```
```{R}
df = read.csv('CVD.csv')

#  'Sex' to a factor
df$Sex <- factor(df$Sex)

df$General_Health <- factor(df$General_Health)

df$Checkup <- factor(df$Checkup)

#  'Age_Category' to a factor
df$Age_Category <- factor(df$Age_Category)

#  'Smoking_History' to a factor
df$Smoking_History <- factor(df$Smoking_History)

#  'Heart_Disease' to a factor
df$Heart_Disease <- factor(df$Heart_Disease)

#  'Skin_Cancer' to a factor
df$Skin_Cancer <- factor(df$Skin_Cancer)

#  'Other_Cancer' to a factor
df$Other_Cancer <- factor(df$Other_Cancer)

#  'Arthritis' to a factor
df$Arthritis <- factor(df$Arthritis)

#  'Depression' to a factor
df$Depression <- factor(df$Depression)

#  'Diabetes' to a factor
df$Diabetes <- factor(df$Diabetes)

#  'Diabetes' to a factor
df$Exercise <- factor(df$Exercise)

str(df)

```
```{R}
# Make sure 'Heart_Disease' is a factor for classification
df$Heart_Disease <- as.factor(df$Heart_Disease)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
split <- createDataPartition(df$Heart_Disease, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
trainData <- df[split, ]
testData <- df[-split, ]
```

```{R}
# Define fitControl
fitControl <- trainControl(
  method = "cv",          # Use cross-validation
  number = 10,            # Number of folds in the cross-validation
  classProbs = TRUE,      # Compute class probabilities, needed for some models
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary # Summary function for binary classification
)

# Train a Naive Bayes model
nbModel <- train(
  Heart_Disease ~ ., 
  data = trainData, 
  method = "naive_bayes", 
  trControl = fitControl
)

# Predictions with the Naive Bayes model
nbPredictions <- predict(nbModel, newdata = testData)

# Evaluate the Naive Bayes model
confusionMatrix(nbPredictions, testData$Heart_Disease)
